      <h3>About CKTS</h3>

      <h6>CK Tech Services was founded in 2017 to provide producers and AV production companies with system level signal flowcharts and production design.</h6>

      <h6>These products assist my clients with sourcing appropriate technology and staff for their events as well as assist them in winning bids and communicating complex designs in a highly visual way to their clients.</h6>

      <h6>Since all of my work is for top tier and Fortune100 end clients in a very competitive industry, I can't share samples of my work online. However, I would be happy to discuss your project and provide some targeted examples of work that would be similar. If I can't share past examples, I can often mock up some concepts to enable you to pitch my services to your supply chain or end client.</h6>

      <h6>CKTS is also an excellent resource for audio/visual purchase and ROI consulting. With vast connections in the indusrty for nearly three decades, CKTS and my associates can often provide high value procurement consulting for large and diverse equipment purchases and equipment package design. My signal flowcharts will verify that all paths are available to meet the overall package performance criteria. I can assist in sourcing, price negotiations, and delivery logistics.</h6>

      <h6>With my extensive experience in the field and on the road, I can design and source transport cases that fit your trucking, protection, and egornomic goals increasing truck pack density and gear per truck, as well as reducing potential liability from employee injury.</h6>

      <h6>Please reach out to me today to see how I can help improve your top and bottom lines.</h6>

      <h6>Sincerely,</h6>

      <h6>Cindy Knode, Founder</h6>
